# Stress-effects-on-university-students

This project investigates the relationship between stress, working memory, and mental health outcomes. Open data resources were used. Study 1 investigated stress and working memory performance in older adults (n = 589, 38.9% males, 60.3% females, 0.8% other, Mage = 28.8, SD = 3.48, age range = 61-67). Study 2 investigated stress and mental health in university students (n = 589, 38.9% males, 60.3% females, 0.8% other, Mage = 28.8, SD = 3.48, age range = 17-48). While stress showed no significant relationship with working memory performance, a strong, significant relationship was found between stress and mental health. Gender and age were included as covariates in regression analyses. The findings highlight the complex, non-causal associations between stress, cognitive function, and emotional well-being.
